This is my modified version of nlopez's cool library. Show marker only if it is on visible area of screen and is not out of screen.

Clusterer
=========

Clustering library for points of interest in Android v2 Maps.

Getting Started
---------------

You can add the project with maven or gradle via adding the appropiate dependence.

### Maven

The dependency is:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.nlopez.clusterer</groupId>
	<artifactId>library</artifactId>
	<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

And you should use my repository in your pom.xml too:
```xml
<repository>
    <id>nlopez-repository</id>
    <url>http://maven.nlopez.io:8081/artifactory/repo</url>
</repository>
```

Preparing your app
------------------

You should have a working Google Maps v2 in your application, with the proper keys and all the stuff needed. Then you should follow these steps.

### In your Model

In the model you are using for referencing a point of interest, you should implement the `Clusterable` interface. That interface only needs a method that returns a LatLng position with the appropiate coordinates, called `getPosition()`.

An example:
```java
public class MyPoi implements Clusterable {
	private String name;
	private LatLng position;

	public MyPoi(String name, LatLng position) {
		this.name = name;
		this.position = position;
	}

	public String getName() { return name; }

	@Override
	public LatLng getPosition() { return position; }
}
```

### Where you have a reference to the GoogleMap object

In the class you are using the GoogleMap object, you must instance the **Clusterer** object.

```java
	GoogleMap map;
	Clusterer clusterer;

	// [...]

	private void initClusterer() {
		clustered = new Clusterer(this, map);
	}

```

The **Clusterer** will control your zoom and will reload the cluster markers when the zoom changes without your interaction.

**NOTE** You shouldn't control the `GoogleMap.OnCameraChangeListener` on your own anymore, you should let `Clusterer` handle it. If you want to add some functionality to it or control on your own, you should set that callback in `Clusterer` instead.

Example:

```java
    clusterer.setOnCameraChangeListener(
        new GoogleMap.OnCameraChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onCameraChange(CameraPosition cameraPosition) {
                // Do your thing in here
            });
        }
    );
```

Customization
-------------

You can customize the marker's appearance, even if it's a cluster marker. You have **two listeners** that will be invoked when the markers are being generated by the **Clusterer** and will be able to provide the markers with the **MarkerOptions** data we want.

Here you have an example that displays the value of an attribute called `description` from our `PointOfInterest` model as the subtitle, and an attribute `name` as the title. If the marker is a cluster, it will display a drawable with the number of points contained in the cluster painted on top of it.

```java
		clusterer.setOnPaintingMarkerListener(new OnPaintingClusterableMarkerListener() {

			@Override
			public void onMarkerCreated(Marker marker, Clusterable clusterable) {
                // If you want to perform some animation or whatever, you could do it here
			}

			@Override
			public MarkerOptions onCreateMarkerOptions(Clusterable clusterable) {
				PointOfInterest poi = (PointOfInterest) clusterable;
				return new MarkerOptions().position(clusterable.getPosition()).title(poi.getName()).snippet(poi.getDescription());
			}
		});

		clusterer.setOnPaintingClusterListener(new OnPaintingClusterListener() {

			@Override
			public void onMarkerCreated(Marker marker, Cluster cluster) {
                // If you want to perform some animation or whatever, you could do it here
			}

			@Override
			public MarkerOptions onCreateClusterMarkerOptions(Cluster cluster) {
				return new MarkerOptions()
						.title("Clustering " + cluster.getWeight() + " items")
						.position(cluster.getCenter())
						.icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromBitmap(
						        getClusteredLabel(cluster.getWeight(),
								MainActivity.this)));
			}
		});

	}

    // A little method that creates a composition with an image from the drawables and the number of pois included in a particular cluster
    private Bitmap getClusteredLabel(Integer count, Context ctx) {
        Resources r = ctx.getResources();
        Bitmap res = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(r, R.drawable.circle_red);
        res = res.copy(Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888, true);
        Canvas c = new Canvas(res);

        Paint textPaint = new Paint();
        textPaint.setAntiAlias(true);
        textPaint.setTextAlign(Paint.Align.CENTER);
        textPaint.setTypeface(Typeface.DEFAULT_BOLD);
        textPaint.setColor(Color.WHITE);
        float density = getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;
        textPaint.setTextSize(16 * density);

        c.drawText(String.valueOf(count.toString()), res.getWidth() / 2, res.getHeight() / 2 + textPaint.getTextSize() / 3, textPaint);

        return res;
    }
```

As you can see, the listeners for the interfaces `OnPaintingClusterableMarkerListener` and `OnPaintingClusterListener` let you do anything you want to the markers, whether if they are a cluster or a point of interest in their own.
